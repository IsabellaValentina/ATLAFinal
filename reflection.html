                &emsp;Responsive Design by definition is a web design that responds to it environment. Unlike adaptive
                design
                which requires many different layouts, responsive design uses one layout with containers that move as
                needed. Responsive Design are practices that allow web pages to accommodate the many screen sizes and
                resolutions for their users. It is a graphic tool set that allows for smooth transitions between
                different interface sizes. The same website viewed by phone, tablet or computer monitor will not change
                drastically, nor will it become an unreadable mess. As an article on mozilla wrote “It is important to
                understand that responsive web design isn't a separate technology — it is a term used to describe an
                approach to web design” <br>
                &emsp;The three most important attributes in a responsive design are fluid grids, fluid images and media
                query. Though listed last, the creation of media queries allows us to use responsive design. Used in the
                style sheet it checks screen size and goes down the list to implement the best format for the size. For
                example, a phone would have a single column but the same site on a tablet will have two columns and a
                larger monitor could have three or four. The meta tag is used to tell the browser what the mobile
                device’s width is and how to scale down appropriately. <br>
                &emsp;Fluid grids is not just about the grid itself but the content. The text within the grid must be as
                flexible as the grid containers. If a browser’s size or screen resolution is not what is considered the
                minimum by technologies standards, how will the design translate? Instead of using fixed units such as
                point(pt) or pica(pc) the designer must use relative units such as %, pixels(px) and em. Relative units
                require context. As Marcotte wrote in the article Fluid Grids “the actual size of an element’s em is
                computed relative to the font-size of its parent element.” If the body font is set to 100% you no longer
                need to choose px . To get larger or smaller text you simply divide the desired size in px by the
                default px(usually 14-16), And use the remainder as the size in em for the element. Now if the
                resolution or browser is smaller/larger the header will still only be a percentage bigger or smaller
                than the body. Target/context = result is used for the containers as well, hence the fluid grid. Fluid
                images uses the technique of setting max-width = 100%, which will then scale to the appropriate size.
                However, it is important to use the attributes sizes so that multiple sizes of a photo are available
                depending on the size of the screen to cut down on bandwidth. <br>
                &emsp;I found this course to be informative and interesting. Although I will likely not be going into
                front
                end web design, this course has taught me about how coding can be vastly different yet achieve the same
                output. One form can be submitted 4 ways and still have the same result. It also taught me about design,
                elements and what to look out for while creating a website. The importance of flexibility as well as
                adhering to accessibility standards are on the forefront of design and being able to translate an idea
                into clean code that passes the standards takes forethought and planning. Though HTML and CSS are not
                difficult languages to learn they still require care to understand how to use them to their full
                potential.<br><br>
